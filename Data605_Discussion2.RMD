# I will be solving Exercise DM.C22

#install.packages('matlib')

```{r}
library(matlib)
```

Theorem DMST : Determinant of Matrices(A) of Size 2

det(A) = ad - bc

```{r}
cat("Matrix A", "\n", "\n")
```

```{r}
(A = matrix(c(1,3,2,6), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE))
```

Now calculating the determinant manually:

```{r}
(Manual_Det_A = (1*6 - 2*3))
```

Manual_Det_A is 0

Now lets try using the function in R:

```{r}
(Det_Using_R = det(A))
```

Det_Using_R is also 0
